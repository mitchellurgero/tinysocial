# TinySocial!

The *first* true flat-file backed social network. Complete with a no-nonsense UI.

Being that it is a flat file backed social network, it can run virtually anywhere PHP7 is supported. However, due to many hosting providers "slow" read/write speed this might not be a viable option for you.

Self-hosting (VPS or private in house) is probably the best way to go.
